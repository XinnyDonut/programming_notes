Absolutely! Here’s an **easy-to-understand explanation** about **threat modeling in cybersecurity**, especially useful if you’re preparing for a graduate role.

# What Is Threat Modeling?

**Threat modeling** is a process used in cybersecurity to identify, understand, and address potential security risks in a system, application, or organisation.

Think of it as **imagining all the ways a “bad actor” (like a hacker) could try to break into a castle** (your system), and then coming up with defences for each of those possible attacks.

---

## Why Is Threat Modeling Important?

- Helps find **weak points** before they can be exploited.
- Saves **time and money** by addressing issues early.
- Ensures the system is **robust and secure** before being released or updated.

---

## How Does Threat Modeling Work? (Simple Steps)

Here’s how you might do it, step-by-step:

1. **Understand the System**

   - Learn what the system does, how it works, and what “valuable stuff” it holds (data, controls, etc.).

2. **Create a Diagram**

   - Draw a simple picture showing how the parts connect—like users, servers, databases, and network connections.

3. **Identify Potential Threats**

   - Ask questions like:
     - What could go wrong?
     - Who might want to attack us and why?
     - Where is sensitive data stored or transmitted?

4. **Rate the Risks**

   - Decide which threats are the most serious based on how likely they are and how much damage they could cause.

5. **Work Out Solutions**
   - Plan ways to block or reduce those threats (e.g., adding better passwords, encrypting data, updating software).

---

## Real-World Example

Imagine you’re building a new **banking app**:

- One threat: hackers trying to steal customer login info.
- You spot this by threat modeling, and you decide to use **two-factor authentication**, so it’s much harder for hackers to break in.

---

## Common Threat Modeling Frameworks

- **STRIDE**: Helps you remember types of threats (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).
- **PASTA**, **OCTAVE**, and others are used by larger organisations for more complex systems.

# Key Takeaway

**Threat modeling is like playing “what if?” with your system**, finding the bad stuff that could happen, and making a plan so it doesn’t happen.

If you were to mention threat modeling in a graduate interview, show that you understand it’s about **anticipating problems before they occur**—and that it’s a team activity, not just for technical experts!

Would you like some tips on how to talk about this in an interview?

Great question! Here’s what it means when we say **threat modeling is a team activity**:

---

## Why Is Threat Modeling a Team Activity?

While technical knowledge is important, **threat modeling works best when people from different backgrounds and roles work together**. Here’s why:

### 1. **Different Perspectives**

- **Developers** know how code works.
- **System administrators** understand infrastructure and deployment.
- **Product owners** know how users interact with the system.
- **Security experts** look for weaknesses.
- When **all these people collaborate**, you get a fuller picture of possible threats. Someone might spot a risk that others wouldn’t have thought of on their own!

### 2. **Better Solutions**

- Teams can brainstorm and discuss the best ways to reduce risks.
- There might be trade-offs (like security vs usability), and different team members can advise on what’s most appropriate for the business and the users.

### 3. **More Buy-In**

- When everyone’s involved, they’re more likely to understand and support the security measures that come out of the process.

---

## Example

Imagine you’re building an online store:

- A **developer** suggests encrypting payment information.
- A **support representative** brings up concerns about handling customer complaints if there are login issues.
- A **business analyst** might remind everyone that the solution shouldn’t slow down the checkout process too much.
- The **security specialist** advises on password policies and fraud detection.

**Everyone's input helps build a safer, better product.**

## In Interviews

If this comes up, you can say:

> “Threat modeling isn’t just for the security team—it works best when developers, business owners, and support staff work together, because everyone brings valuable knowledge about different parts of the system and its use.”
