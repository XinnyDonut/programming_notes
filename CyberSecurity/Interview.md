### Introduction

"I'm currently completing my Master of Software Development at Victoria University after transitioning from a career as a chef. I recently interned at Theta, working on their enterprise GenAI solution, which sparked my interest in security. I'm particularly drawn to [GRC/penetration testing] because [specific reason], and I'm excited to learn how my background in problem-solving and adaptability could be valuable at Bastion."

### potential questions

- "How do you structure mentorship relationships between new graduates and senior consultants?"
- "What are the most common types of engagements new consultants work on initially?"
- "How do you balance technical training with developing client communication skills?"
- "What qualities separate successful graduates in your program from others?"
- "How does Bastion stay ahead of emerging security threats and technologies?"

### Basic concept

- CIA triad
- Threat Modeling

Basic threat modeling: STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
Key security terms: Vulnerability, exploit, threat actor, attack vector, defense in depth

### Potential Informal Open Day Questions & Model Answers

1.  "What interests you about cybersecurity?"
    Model answer: "I'm fascinated by the constant evolution of threats and defenses in cybersecurity. During my software development training and internship at Theta, I realized how crucial security considerations are at every step of development. When implementing OpenAI's Assistant API at Theta, I had to carefully consider authentication, data protection, and API security - which sparked my interest in how security systems are designed and tested. I'm excited by the challenge of staying ahead of potential vulnerabilities."

2.  "Why Bastion specifically?"
    Model answer: "Bastion's comprehensive approach to security across multiple domains - from governance to penetration testing to incident response - offers a unique opportunity to develop broad expertise. I'm particularly drawn to your structured graduate program with its combination of formal training and real client engagement. The mentorship aspect is especially appealing as I transition into cybersecurity from software development."

3.  "What makes you think you'd be a good fit for cybersecurity without a traditional background?"
    Model answer: "My transition from chef to software developer has given me valuable adaptability and quick learning skills. In both roles, I've had to solve complex problems under pressure - whether managing kitchen operations during challenging periods or debugging critical software issues. At Theta, I quickly learned to work with enterprise systems and APIs, showing I can master technical concepts efficiently. I believe these transferable skills, combined with my technical education and genuine interest in security, will allow me to bring a fresh perspective to cybersecurity challenges."

### Key Cybersecurity Concepts to Familiarize Yourself With

- For Both Paths:

CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
Basic threat modeling: STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
Key security terms: Vulnerability, exploit, threat actor, attack vector, defense in depth

- For GRC Path Focus:

Risk assessment basics: Understanding risk calculation (impact Ã— likelihood)
Compliance basics: ISO 27001, Privacy Act 2020, GDPR
Security policy development: The purpose and structure of security policies

- For Penetration Testing Path Focus:

Web application security basics: OWASP Top 10
Basic network security concepts: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, network segmentation
Common security tools: Awareness of Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Metasploit
