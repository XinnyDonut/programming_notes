### Key Talking Points About AI and Security

1. AI-Specific Security Vulnerabilities

   - Prompt injection attacks:

     "Working with OpenAI's Assistant API at Theta made me aware of prompt injection vulnerabilities. These attacks can manipulate AI systems into bypassing security controls or leaking sensitive information."
     "I find it fascinating how traditional input validation approaches need to evolve for AI systems, where the boundary between code and natural language is blurred."

   - Model poisoning concerns:

     "As organizations increasingly train custom AI models on their proprietary data, ensuring the integrity of training data becomes a critical security challenge."
     "At Theta, I saw firsthand how enterprises worry about protecting both their training data and the resulting models."

2. AI in Security Operations

   - Detection capabilities:

     "I'm interested in how AI can transform threat detection by identifying anomalous patterns that traditional rule-based systems might miss."
     "The balance between reducing false positives while maintaining comprehensive coverage seems like a fascinating challenge."

   - Automation potential:

     "During my work with enterprise AI solutions, I realized how AI could automate repetitive security tasks like log analysis or vulnerability prioritization."
     "I'd be curious to learn how Bastion is incorporating AI into its security operations to enhance consultant effectiveness."

3. Defensive Applications of AI

   - Proactive threat hunting:

     "My experience with AI systems suggests they could revolutionize proactive security by predicting potential attack vectors before they're exploited."
     "I'm interested in how predictive capabilities might change security postures from reactive to anticipatory."

   - Security testing:

     "AI could potentially generate more realistic and comprehensive penetration testing scenarios by learning from real-world attack patterns."
     "I wonder if tools like this could complement human expertise in security assessments."

4. Governance Challenges

   - Compliance implications:

     "Working with enterprise AI at Theta showed me the complex compliance challenges around data privacy, bias, and model governance."

     "I'm particularly interested in how frameworks like NZ's Privacy Act need to evolve to address AI-specific considerations."

   - Risk assessment for AI systems:

     "Traditional risk frameworks weren't designed with AI systems in mind, creating interesting challenges for security practitioners."

     "I'd love to learn how Bastion approaches risk assessment for clients implementing AI technologies."

5. Emerging Threat Landscape

   - AI-powered attacks:

     "The democratization of AI tools means threat actors can now use them to craft more convincing phishing emails or scale their operations."

     "I'm curious how security operations must evolve to counter adversarial AI capabilities."

   - Deep fakes and authentication:

     "My work with generative AI has made me acutely aware of how authentication systems based on biometrics or voice recognition might be compromised."

     "This seems like an area where security practices need to rapidly evolve."

### Framework for Discussing Your Interest

When bringing up this topic, you might structure your thoughts like this:

- Personal connection: "My work at Theta implementing enterprise AI solutions has given me direct experience with the security challenges these technologies present."
- Specific observation: "For example, when implementing OpenAI's Assistant API, we had to carefully design authentication protocols and data handling practices to prevent sensitive information exposure."
- Broader implication: "This experience made me realize how AI is creating entirely new categories of security concerns that traditional approaches aren't designed to address."
- Future interest: "I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to help organizations navigate these emerging challenges, whether through governance frameworks or technical controls."
- Question for them: "How is Bastion seeing AI impact your clients' security concerns, and what approaches are you taking to address these new challenges?"

### Final Tips

When discussing AI security, be specific about your experiences rather than speaking in generalities
Show awareness of both the risks and benefits of AI in security contexts
Position yourself as someone interested in building bridges between emerging technology and security practices
Be prepared to discuss specific examples from your Theta internship where AI and security intersected
Express curiosity about Bastion's perspective on these issues rather than presenting yourself as having all the answers

This approach will demonstrate that you're not only technically informed but also thinking strategically about where the industry is headed â€“ exactly the kind of forward-looking mindset that security consultancies value!
