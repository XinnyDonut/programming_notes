### Understanding of the Options Pattern in ASP.NET Core

#### what is Options pattern?

Options pattern is a design pattern specifically introduced by the ASP.NET Core team. It's not one of the classic Gang of Four patterns, but rather a pattern designed to solve the specific problem of configuration management in modern applications.
The Options pattern is Microsoft's recommended approach for:

1. Reading configuration data
2. Organizing configuration into logical groups
3. Validating configuration
4. Reloading configuration when changes occur

#### Enabling IOptions in your application

To use the Options pattern, you need to:

1. Add the required package: It's included in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Options` package, which comes as part of the standard ASP.NET Core metapackage. You typically don't need to add it explicitly.
2. Register the options services: This is usually done in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
// Modern minimal API style in Program.cs
builder.Services.Configure<AppSettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings"));

// OR in older Startup.ConfigureServices
services.Configure<AppSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings"));
```

#### IOptions is Gneric

By default, ASP.NET Core can read configuration from:

- JSON files: appsettings.json, appsettings.{Environment}.json
- Environment variables: System or process environment variables
- Command-line arguments: Values passed when starting the application
- User secrets: Used during development for sensitive data
- Azure Key Vault: For secure storage of sensitive information
- Custom configuration providers: Any custom source you implement

These are loaded in a specific order, with later sources overriding earlier ones. For example, an environment variable will override the same setting in appsettings.json.

The Options pattern `(IOptions, IOptionsSnapshot, IOptionsMonitor)` works with this entire configuration system, not just with settings in `appsettings.json`.

```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "BaseApiUrl": "https://localhost:61645"
  },
  "Database": {
    "ConnectionString": "Server=localhost;Database=MyDb",
    "CommandTimeout": 30
  },
  "Authentication": {
    "JwtSecret": "your-secret-key",
    "TokenExpirationMinutes": 60
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

You can create multiple strongly-typed configuration classes for different parts of your application:

```csharp
public class DatabaseSettings
{
    public string ConnectionString { get; set; }
    public int CommandTimeout { get; set; }
}

public class AuthSettings
{
    public string JwtSecret { get; set; }
    public int TokenExpirationMinutes { get; set; }
}
```

And register them for use with the Options pattern:

```csharp
services.Configure<AppSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings"));
services.Configure<DatabaseSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("Database"));
services.Configure<AuthSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("Authentication"));
```

Then inject only what each service needs:

```csharp
public class DataService
{
    // Only needs database settings
    public DataService(IOptionsSnapshot<DatabaseSettings> dbOptions)
    {
        var settings = dbOptions.Value;
        // Use settings.ConnectionString, etc.
    }
}

public class AuthService
{
    // Only needs auth settings
    public AuthService(IOptionsSnapshot<AuthSettings> authOptions)
    {
        var settings = authOptions.Value;
        // Use settings.JwtSecret, etc.
    }
}
```
