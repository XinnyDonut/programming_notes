```ts
declare global {
  interface Window {
    saveThread?: () => void;
  }
}
```

- `declare global`: This is a TypeScript feature that allows you to extend global types. In this case, you're telling TypeScript that you want to add something to the global scope.
- `interface Window`: You're extending the built-in Window interface. The Window interface represents the browser window and contains properties like document, location, etc.TypeScript doesn't replace the original Window interface - it merges your new property with all the existing ones.
- `saveThread?: () => void`;: You're declaring that the Window object may have a property called saveThread which is a function that takes no parameters and returns nothing (void). The ? means it's optional.
